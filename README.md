or attempts to do so, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 3 years, or both.
##(e)In a prosecution for an offense under this section, it is an affirmative defense, as to which the defendant has the burden of
proof by a preponderance of the evidence, that the conduct consisted solely of lawful conduct and that the defendant’s
sole intention was to encourage, induce, or cause the other person to testify truthfully.
##(f)For the purposes of this section—
(1)an official proceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of the offense; and
(2)the testimony, or the record, document, or other object need not be admissible in evidence or free of a claim of
privilege.
##(g)In a prosecution for an offense under this section, no state of mind need be proved with respect to the circumstance—
(1) that the official proceeding before a judge, court, magistrate judge, grand jury, or government agency is before a judge or
court of the United States, a United States magistrate judge, a bankruptcy judge, a Federal grand jury, or a Federal
Government agency; or
(2) that the judge is a judge of the United States or that the law enforcement officer is an officer or employee of the Federal Government or a person authorized to act for or on behalf of the Federal Government or serving the Federal Government as an adviser or consultant.
(h) There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section.
(i) A prosecution under this section or section 1503 may be brought in the district in which the official proceeding
(whether or not pending or about to be instituted) was intended to be affected or in the district in which the conduct constituting the alleged offense occurred.
(j) If the offense under this section occurs in connection with a trial of a criminal case, the maximum term of imprisonment which may be imposed for the offense shall be the higher of that otherwise provided by law or the maximum term that could have been imposed for any offense charged in such case.
(k) Whoever conspires to commit any offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense the commission of which was the object of the conspiracy.

TY. Very much appreciated.
